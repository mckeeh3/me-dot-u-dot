        <h2>About this App</h2>
        <p>
          Me-Dot-U-Dot is an Akka-powered application that explores self-learning AI agents within a two-player board game environment. The core focus is observing how specific agents with their
          unique models evolve and improve their gameplay strategies over time through experience. Each agent maintains a playbook journal that captures its learning progression, allowing you to track
          how different models adapt, develop tactics, and refine their decision-making processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The application provides valuable insights into model performance characteristics, including response times during each move, which helps compare how quickly various AI models process game
          situations and make decisions. This makes it an excellent tool for understanding both the learning capabilities and operational efficiency of different AI models in a game-playing context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend uses event-sourced entities, views, and agent components to manage game state, player data, and agent playbooks, while the UI provides a clean, modern experience to create
          players, start games, and observe the evolution of agent gameplay strategies.

        <ul>
          <li>Use the navigation button to switch between pages.</li>
          <li>Select or create Player 1 and Player 2.</li>
          <li>
            Creating players:
            <ul>
              <li>Enter a unique player ID and a display name.</li>
              <li>Choose a type: human or agent.</li>
              <li>If you choose agent, select an available model before creating the player.</li>
              <li>If you enter an existing player ID, the form auto-fills and the type/model fields become read-only.</li>
              <li>Once you create a player, you can edit it by clicking the player name in the player list.</li>
              <li>You cannot change the player type or model after creation.</li>
              <li>The Create & Select button becomes Update & Select when editing an existing player.</li>

          <li>Choose a game level after both players are selected, then begin the game.</li>
          <li>During play, the board shows available moves and current status. Agent turns are automatic.</li>
          <li>You can cancel a game, or reset after it completes.</li>
          <li>For agent players, open the journal viewer to read the agent's playbook entries.</li>
          <li>Opponent combinations supported: human vs human, human vs agent, and agent vs agent.</li>
          <li>The game is played in real-time, with each player's turn being automatic.</li>
          <li>For agent players, during game play, you can view their playbook journal entries.</li>

        <h2>Agent Players</h2>
        <p>
          Agent players are AI-powered entities that use large language models to make game decisions. Each agent is uniquely identified by its agent ID and is configured with a specific model (e.g.,
          GPT-4, Claude, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Agents operate through a structured system prompt that guides their behavior and learning process. They follow a mandatory tool protocol on each turn and maintain a persistent playbook for
          continuous improvement.
        </p>
        <h3>Agent Tools</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Get Game State Tool:</strong> Retrieves the current game state in a compact format, including board positions, player scores, move history, and whose turn it is.</li>
          <li><strong>Get Your Playbook Tool:</strong> Accesses the agent's persistent playbook containing self-authored instructions, tactics, and lessons learned from previous games.</li>
          <li><strong>Make Move Tool:</strong> Submits a move to the game by specifying board coordinates (e.g., "C3").</li>
          <li><strong>Update Your Playbook Tool:</strong> Allows the agent to revise its playbook with new insights, refined strategies, or corrections based on game experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Learning Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Agents must call tools in a specific sequence: get game state → get playbook → decide move → make move → optionally update playbook.</li>
          <li>The playbook serves as the agent's memory and learning mechanism, storing tactical knowledge that persists across games.</li>
          <li>Agents are instructed to be evidence-driven, balancing exploration of new strategies with exploitation of proven tactics.</li>
          <li>After each game, agents analyze outcomes and update their playbooks with new insights, successful patterns, or failure modes to avoid.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Playbook Viewer</h2>
        <p>
          The playbook is the most critical information passed to AI models during gameplay. Along with the current board layout showing which players have selected specific cells, the playbook guides
          the model's decision-making process for the next move.
        </p>
        <p>
          The journal entries capture the evolution of an agent's playbook over time. Each entry represents a specific version of the agent's playbook at the moment it was updated. While models always
          receive the most recent playbook version during gameplay, the journal provides valuable insight into how the agent's strategy and learning evolved across multiple games.
        </p>
        <h3>Using the Viewer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Select an agent from the dropdown to view their complete playbook journal history.</li>
          <li>Navigate between journal entries using the up/down arrows to see how the agent's strategy evolved.</li>
          <li>Each entry displays metadata (Agent ID, Sequence ID, Updated At) and the full playbook instructions from that point in time.</li>
          <li>Compare entries across time to understand how the agent learned from wins, losses, and gameplay patterns.</li>
          <li>The viewer uses the same visual style and dropdown components as the game page for consistency.</li>
        </ul>
