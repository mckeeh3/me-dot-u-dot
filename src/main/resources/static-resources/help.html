            <h2>About this App</h2>
            <p>
              Me-Dot-U-Dot is an Akka-powered application that explores self-learning AI agents within a two-player board game environment. The core focus is observing how specific agents with their
              unique models evolve and improve their gameplay strategies over time through experience. Each agent maintains a playbook journal that captures its learning progression, allowing you to
              track how different models adapt, develop tactics, and refine their decision-making processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application provides valuable insights into model performance characteristics, including response times during each move, which helps compare how quickly various AI models process
              game situations and make decisions. This makes it an excellent tool for understanding both the learning capabilities and operational efficiency of different AI models in a game-playing
              context.
            </p>
            <p>
              The backend uses event-sourced entities, views, and agent components to manage game state, player data, and agent playbooks, while the UI provides a clean, modern experience to create
              players, start games, and observe the evolution of agent gameplay strategies.

            <h2>Agent Players</h2>
            <p>
              Agent players are AI-powered entities that use large language models to make game decisions. Each agent is uniquely identified by its agent ID and is configured with a specific model
              (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              Agents operate through a structured system prompt that guides their behavior and learning process. They follow a mandatory tool protocol on each turn and maintain a persistent playbook
              for continuous improvement. Both the playbook and the system prompt are unique to the agent player and are never shared with other agents. When an agent player is created it starts from
              the default system prompt, and the selected model is permanently tied to that agent—once chosen it cannot be changed. From that point forward the agent player’s model is responsible for
              deciding how to evolve its own playbook and system prompt.
            </p>
            <h3>Agent Tools</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Get Game State Tool:</strong> Retrieves the current game state as a structured CompactGameState object containing:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Game Info:</strong> Game ID, creation timestamp, status (empty/in_progress/won_by_player/draw/canceled), and current player ID</li>
                  <li><strong>Players:</strong> List of both players with their ID, name, type (human/agent), move count, score, and winner status</li>
                  <li><strong>Board Info:</strong> Level (one=5x5 through nine=21x21), top-left square coordinates (A1), and bottom-right square coordinates</li>
                  <li><strong>Move History:</strong> Chronological list of all moves with square ID and player ID for each move</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Get Your Playbook Tool:</strong> Accesses the agent's persistent playbook containing self-authored instructions, tactics, and lessons learned from previous games.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Get Your System Prompt Tool:</strong> Fetches the agent player's current system prompt so the model can review its durable role guidance before deciding how to evolve it.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Make Move Tool:</strong> Submits a move to the game by specifying board coordinates (e.g., "C3").</li>
              <li><strong>Update Your Playbook Tool:</strong> Allows the agent to rewrite its playbook with new insights, refined strategies, or corrections based on game experience.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Update Your System Prompt Tool:</strong> Enables an agent player to replace its system prompt with a fully revised version, giving each model the ability to evolve its core
                role and guardrails over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Get Game Move History Tool:</strong> Returns the enriched move history (including scoring sequences) so agents can perform post-game analysis before revising their playbooks or
                system prompts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Learning Process</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Agents must call tools in a specific sequence: get game state → get playbook/system prompt → decide move → make move → optionally update playbook and/or system prompt.</li>
              <li>
                The playbook serves as the agent's memory and learning mechanism, storing tactical knowledge that persists across games, while the system prompt captures durable behavioral guidance
                that the model can refine over time.
              </li>
              <li>Agents are instructed to be evidence-driven, balancing exploration of new strategies with exploitation of proven tactics.</li>
              <li>
                After each game, agents analyze outcomes (often using the move history tool) and update their playbooks or system prompts with new insights, successful patterns, or failure modes to
                avoid.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Playbook Viewer</h2>
            <p>
              The playbook is the most critical information passed to AI models during gameplay. Along with the current board layout showing which players have selected specific squares, the playbook
              guides the model's decision-making process for the next move.
            </p>
            <p>
              The journal entries capture the evolution of an agent's playbook over time. Each entry represents a specific version of the agent's playbook at the moment it was updated. While models
              always receive the most recent playbook version during gameplay, the journal provides valuable insight into how the agent's strategy and learning evolved across multiple games.
            </p>
            <h3>Using the Viewer</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Select an agent from the dropdown to view their complete playbook journal history.</li>
              <li>Navigate between journal entries using the up/down arrows to see how the agent's strategy evolved.</li>
              <li>Each entry displays metadata (Agent ID, Sequence ID, Updated At) and the full playbook instructions from that point in time.</li>
              <li>Compare entries across time to understand how the agent learned from wins, losses, and gameplay patterns.</li>
              <li>The viewer uses the same visual style and dropdown components as the game page for consistency.</li>

            <h2>Agent Role Viewer</h2>
            <p>
              The agent role viewer exposes the versioned system prompts that shape each agent's core behavior. While the playbook captures tactical knowledge, the system prompt defines the persistent
              role and guardrails the agent follows when interacting with the game and tools.
            </p>
            <h3>Using the Viewer</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Select an agent to inspect the historical system prompts attached to that identity.</li>
              <li>Move between revisions to see how the agent's role definition evolved over time.</li>
              <li>The diff toggle highlights changes between consecutive prompts to surface meaningful adjustments quickly.</li>
              <li>Use this history to compare playbook updates with role refinements and understand their combined impact on gameplay.</li>
